        Use this as a TEMPLATE:

        - Make sure the first setence is always "... Your X needs to be on fire", where X is TOPIC summarised.
        - Start the PASSAGE with five spaces.
        - You are allowed to change the structure if it makes it better. You don't have to repeat the words and in the TEMPLATE, you can change them as you like. it should only flow this way in terms of the sentence structure. be creative
        - Use wordplay and puns

        Print only one single PASSAGE.

        TOPIC: ${bio}${
          bio.slice(-1) === '.' ? '' : '.'
        }`,
      },
    ],
  });

  // Convert the response into a friendly text-stream
  const stream = OpenAIStream(response);
  // Respond with the stream
  return new StreamingTextResponse(stream);
}
